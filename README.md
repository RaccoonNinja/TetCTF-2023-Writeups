Original write-ups by [:raccoon::ninja:](https://ctf.hackemall.live/users/1522) on [TetCTF 2023](https://ctf.hackemall.live).

I'd like to express my gratitude to the organizers for hosting this CTF and supporting us on Tet Nguyen Dan. Many challenges in this CTF went above my head but I definitely got my lì xì!

### Challenges solved:
- Web: **Image Services Viewer**
- Crypto: Casino (beginner friendly)
- Web: NewYearBot (fluked it)
- Misc: Welcome (won't be writing write-up for this)

### Challenges attempted:
- Web: GIFT
- Crypto: shuffle128
- ~~Looked at shuffle64, *closed seeing the "RC4 has biased outputs at the beginning" message*~~
- ~~Looked at casino2~~
- ~~Looked at pwn01, *closed IDA as the program looked long*~~

## Reflections

It was a surprise - I didn't thought of joining this CTF initially (usually I tend to play more beginner-friendly CTFs) but it's such a great way to start off this year. So I dropped in 6-7 hours after start after church (which is important).

There are the *3 really easy challenges*, then it's **well within the intermediate zone**. In the writeup for CSR2022 I mentioned that the marked difficulty somewhat hindered me from trying harder problems. The difficulties in this CTF are dynamically marked by number of solves (like some other CTFs).

As a solo player, time management is ever so crucial - **it's paramount to hit challenges on the mark and not waste time on harder problems**. I was caught offguard by GIFT as it initially had more solves (I'm really not familiar with all the hidden tricks and vulnerabilities PHP has to offer), but I was right about the pwn01 and shuffle64 judging by final solves. Of course if ~~the glory of~~ playing solo harms my learning, that can change if the chance comes.

- For web, the easier challenges are hard, often involving 3 or more steps for 1 flag
- For crypto, I'm not familiar with RC4 or other related technologies
